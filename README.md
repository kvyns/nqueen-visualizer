# NQueen-Visualizer

N-Queens Solver
This project is a graphical implementation of the N-Queens problem using Python's tkinter library. The N-Queens problem is a classic algorithmic challenge where the goal is to place N chess queens on an NÃ—N chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other.

## Features
+ Customizable Board Size: A slider can adjust The board size from 4x4 to 12x12.
+ Graphical Representation: The chessboard and queens are displayed graphically, allowing users to visualize the solution.
+ Interactive Interface: Users can manually place and remove queens by clicking on the board.
+ Automatic Solution: The solver uses a backtracking algorithm to find a solution for the given board size.

## Working
+ Initialization: A 4x4 chessboard is displayed by default when the application starts.
+ Adjust Board Size: Use the slider to select the desired board size (up to 12x12).
+ Solve the Problem: Click the "Solve" button to find a solution automatically. If a solution exists, the queens will be placed on the board; otherwise, a message will be displayed.
+ Manual Placement: You can also manually place or remove queens by clicking on the cells of the chessboard.
+ Reset the Board: The "Reset" button clears the board for a fresh start.
